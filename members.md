Jerry was an undergraduate at Nanjing University, where he worked on models of economic growth. He was inspired by the Human Genome Project and moved to Beijing in 2005 to pursue his PhD in Bioinformatics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. There, he worked with Dr. Xiu-Jie Wang developing computational methods to characterize non-coding RNAs. In September 2011, Jerry joined Joe Zhou's lab at the University of Pennsylvania, where he investigated the role of epigenetic mechanisms in the etiology of Rett syndrome and Autism Spectrum Disorder. Jerry started his independent career as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at NYIT in July 2019.

Austin completed his undergraduate education at Stony Brook University in the Biomedical Engineering program, picking up a Bachelor's of Science in Applied Math and Statistics along the way. His specialization was in tissue engineering, the application of biomedical engineering principles at the tissue- and cellular-level. At Stony Brook Austin worked in a lab whose research focused on leveraging microfluidics for quantitative biology and genomics, wherein he developed and built several custom devices including a microbead magnetic rheometer for quantifying hydrogels, an environmental chamber for long-duration mammalian cell microscopy, and an automated turbidostat for yeast evolution studies. He's always working on one project or another, and loves collaborating with and learning from others.
