<h1 id="welcometothelonggenelab">Welcome to the Long Gene Lab!</h1>

<p><img width="300" src="/img/ML_Omics_Lab_1.jpg" data-action="zoom"></p>

<p>We are part of the <a href="https://www.nyit.edu/medicine/department_of_biomedical_sciences">Department of Biomedical Sciences</a> and the Innovation Center in the <a href="https://www.nyit.edu/medicine">College of Osteopathic Medicine</a> at <a href="https://www.nyit.edu/">New York Institute of Technology (NYIT)</a>.<br>
  <br></p>

<p>Research in the Long Gene Laboratory directed by Dr. <strong>"Jerry" Ying-Tao Zhao</strong> is focused on leveraging computational and multi-omics approaches to study brain function and dysfunction, particularly in the developing brain. We are interested in elucidating the impact of the epigenome on the healthy and diseased brain, identifying heterogeneous responses to perturbations in the brain via single cell omics, and discovering new biomedical information from omics data using Machine Learning algorithms.<br>
 <br></p>

<p>We are particularly interested in long genes and the mechanisms regulating long genes transcription and splicing.<br>
 <br></p>

<p>The lab utilizes multidisciplinary approaches including genomics, epigenomics, bioinformatics, computational biology, and mouse genetics.<br>
