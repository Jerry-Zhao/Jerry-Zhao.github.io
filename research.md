## Understand the transcription and co-transcriptional processing of long genes.<br>
Gene length is a critical factor for transcriptional regulation because making a transcript relies on RNA polymerase 2 traveling along the entire gene region. The lengths of protein-coding genes in the human genome range from 0.2 kilobase to 2400 kilobase. Long genes, which consume more time and resources to make a transcript than short genes do, are preferentially deregulated in multiple human diseases. Our recent studies discovered a long-gene-specific epigenetic pattern, suggesting that long genes may require specific mechanisms to overcome the length constraint. However, we have a very limited understanding about these mechanisms. We aim to illuminate the mechanisms regulating the transcription and co-transcriptional processing of long genes using computational and multi-omics approaches.<br>
