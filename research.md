## Elucidate the impact of the epigenome on the healthy and diseased brain.<br>
Neurons carry unique epigenomic features compared to other somatic cells, and epigenomic deregulation is involved in the etiology of many brain disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Indeed, genetic variants associated with ASDs are enriched in genes encoding chromatin regulators. Previously, we discovered that a group of neuronal genes harbor broad enhancer-like chromatin domains (BELD) in their gene bodies. These BELD genes are long in length, express at a relatively high level, and are enriched in synaptic genes. Intriguingly, their expression is vulnerable to mutations in ASD-associated chromatin regulators and to high grade glioma. However, the mechanisms by which BELDs contribute to the robust transcription of these genes and to the etiology of the disorders remain unclear. We plan to utilize multi-omics and mouse genetics approaches to elucidate the impact of BELDs on the healthy and diseased brain.<br>

## Identify heterogeneous responses to perturbations in the brain via single cell omics.
The brain is an organ that contains billions of neurons and non-neuronal cells. These cells belong to many cell types and exhibit a large range of responses to a perturbation. This heterogeneity in responses poses critical challenges for the identification of the “key cells” in response to the perturbation. Particularly, many of the transient and spatiotemporal responses occur in different and rare cell subpopulations, which will be missed by traditional assays measuring the average of all cell populations in a given brain region. Seeking to overcome this heterogeneity, we plan to utilize single cell omics approaches to identify heterogeneous responses in different cells to various perturbations in the brain.<br>

## Discover new information from omics data using Machine Learning algorithms.
Biomedical research has experienced an explosion of new data in the past few years. However, many of these data were generated to test pre-defined hypotheses, indicating that new biomedical information unrelated to the hypotheses may remain hidden in the data. Machine Learning algorithms uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations, and other insights through examining large-scale datasets, which provide a feasible opportunity to develop efficient and effective approaches to discover new information from omics datasets. This new information might be a stepping stone for further biomedical investigations. Thus, we plan to apply Machine Learning algorithms in omics data to discover new biomedical information. We utilize clustering methods (K-Means and Autoencoder) and classifier methods (deep Neural Network) in TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.<br>
