## 1. Understand the transcription and co-transcriptional processing of long genes.<br>
The lengths of protein-coding genes in the human genome range from 0.2 kilobases to 2400 kilobases. Long genes consume more time and resources to make a transcript because gene transcription relies on RNA polymerase II (Pol II) traveling along the entire gene region. Notably, long genes are preferentially dysregulated in multiple human diseases. However, despite the increasing impact of long genes on human health, we have a very limited understanding of how long genes are transcriptionally and co-transcriptionally regulated. We hypothesize that long genes require specific chromatin features, such as histone modifications, to overcome the length constraint for efficient transcription and co-transcriptional processing. Our goal is to elucidate how chromatin features in long genes affect Pol II activities and pre-mRNA splicing. 
<br>
We will accomplish this goal by 1) determining the association and causality between BELD domains and Pol II activities in long genes, 2) characterizing pre-mRNA splicing in long introns using nascent RNA-enriched genomic methods and Machine Learning algorithms, and 3) elucidating the evolutionary perspectives of transcription and co-transcriptional splicing in long genes. Neuronal cells present an ideal system to study long genes because long gene transcription is mostly enriched in the central nervous system. We will investigate long genes in neuronal cells in the mammalian, fish, and avian brains, as well as in neuronal cell lines. The overall impact of this proposal is to advance our mechanistic understanding of the transcription and co-transcriptional processing of long genes, which will provide new insights into the evolutionary perspectives of gene length expansion and the association of long genes with human diseases.


Gene length is a critical factor for transcriptional regulation because making a transcript relies on RNA polymerase 2 traveling along the entire gene region. The lengths of protein-coding genes in the human genome range from 0.2 kilobase to 2400 kilobase. Long genes, which consume more time and resources to make a transcript than short genes do, are preferentially deregulated in multiple human diseases. Our recent studies discovered a long-gene-specific epigenetic pattern, suggesting that long genes may require specific mechanisms to overcome the length constraint. However, we have a very limited understanding about these mechanisms. We aim to illuminate the mechanisms regulating the transcription and co-transcriptional processing of long genes using computational and multi-omics approaches.<br>
