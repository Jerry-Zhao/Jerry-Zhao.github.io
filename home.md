# Welcome to the LongGene Lab!

We are part of the [Department of Biomedical Sciences](https://www.nyit.edu/medicine/department_of_biomedical_sciences) and the Innovation Center.<br>
 <br>
We are located in the Riland Building at the Long Island campus of New York Institute of Technology (NYIT).<br>

 <br>
  <br>

Research in the lab is focused on leveraging computational and multi-omics approaches to understand the brain. We are interested in elucidating the impact of the epigenome on the healthy and diseased brain, identifying heterogeneous responses to perturbations in the brain via single cell omics, and discovering new biomedical information from omics data using Machine Learning algorithms.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 We are particularly interested in long genes and the mechanisms regulating long genes transcription and splicing.<br>
 
  <br>
The lab utilizes approaches including genomics, epigenomics, bioinformatics, computational biology, and mouse genetics.<br>
