# The expression profile of Shank2 in 24 cell types in the mouse cortex. <br>
Gene expression levels were examined by single nuclear RNA-seq. <br>
Slc17a7 is a marker gene for excitatory neurons. <br>
Gad1 is a marker gene for inhibotatory neurons. <br>
Slc1a3 is a marker gene for glial cells. <br>
 <br>
